        <h3>10 Facts about me</h3>
        <li>I'm the youngest child in my family. (6th kid XD)</li>
        <li>I used to baby sit my nephew when I was in grade 6. When he cries, I also cry :'< </li>
        <li>During pandemic I used to take commission edits for a brand</li>
        <li>They say I was matured in an early age (well.. I was just woked in a problematic world LOL #FudgeCorruptPoliticians)</li>
        <li>I enjoy editing</li>
        <li>I easily get distracted by a ton of tasks, which makes me not finish a single thing</li>
        <li>I hate and I love cramming</li>
        <li>I do have leadership skill, but I often have a creativity block when I'm being one (Thats why its better for me to stay as a member. Hehe)</li>
        <li>I hate people who dont have initiative, specially when it already due date</li>
        <li>Deligating task is not really my thing. I prefer to do task on my own rather than assign it to people (which is my down side as a leadr #mahiyainLangs)</li>
